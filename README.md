# Pre-requisitions
- A full pot of coffee (or 10 full pots).
- A good caliper.
- Visual studio code with PlatformIO.
- At least one 1Kg roll of PLA or wathever material you prefer that you don't mind throwing in the garbage.
- 24V/50W Heater rod, chances are they installed a cheap 12V/50W Heater rod in your machine and it's going to burn itself after a few prints.

# First Steps
Try the stock firmware, if it work for you and you can manage to set it up properly and have constant results, stick with that, don't bother with this walkthru. I got tired of always having to adjust/tweak the printer after about 6 month of ownership. Sometime it was producing the best print i've ever seen, other time it wasn't even able to lay a first layer consistently.

Also, if you're running the stock firmware, forget about Octoprint, auto-leveling is not compatible with usb print, so unless your bed isn't perfectly leveled (good luck with that), it will never work.

# All right, time for Marlin
Well, almost, first, back up your current firmware, just in case you regret your next move.
